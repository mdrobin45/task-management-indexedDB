# Task Management with IndexedDB

This project is a task management application that leverages IndexedDB for client-side storage. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks efficiently.

## Features

-  **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks with a title and description.
-  **View Tasks**: Users can view a list of all tasks.
-  **Update Tasks**: Users can edit the details of existing tasks.
-  **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
-  **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in IndexedDB, ensuring data persistence even after the browser is closed.

## Technologies Used

-  **React**: Used for building the user interface and managing the application state.
-  **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling the application with utility-first CSS classes.
-  **IndexedDB**: Employed for client-side storage to ensure data persistence.
